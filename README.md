## 🏴‍☠️ Ahoy, Matey! Welcome Aboard!

Ye've stumbled upon the legendary **Push_swap_sweater** - a treacherous Python contraption that'll make ye sweat more than a cabin boy swabbin' the deck in the doldrums! This be no ordinary script, me hearty. 'Tis a fiendish challenge inspired by the infamous push_swap algorithm that's caused many a programmer to walk the plank of despair!

## 🗺️ What Be This Treasure?

The Push_swap_sweater be a Python script designed to test yer mettle and make ye work harder than a crew rowin' against a hurricane! Just like sortin' through cursed doubloons in Davy Jones' locker, this here program challenges ye to:

- **Sort stacks faster than a pirate counts his plunder** 🪙
- **Optimize yer moves like chartin' the shortest course to treasure island** 🗺️
- **Sweat buckets** while wranglin' with algorithms that'd make even Blackbeard scratch his beard! 🧔

## ⚔️ Features That'll Shiver Yer Timbers

- **🌊 Stack Operations**: Push, swap, and rotate like ye're maneuvering through treacherous waters!
- **🎯 Performance Metrics**: Count yer moves like a quartermaster counts the loot!
- **🏆 Challenge Modes**: From "Landlubber" to "Pirate King" - can ye master 'em all?
- **💀 Sweat-Inducing Complexity**: Guaranteed to make ye perspire more than a gunner in battle!

## 🚢 Installation - Hoist the Colors!

Before ye set sail, make sure ye've got Python installed on yer vessel (Python 3.6 or higher, ye scurvy dog!):

```bash
# Clone this treasure chest
git clone https://github.com/almoraru/Push_swap_sweater.git

# Navigate to the ship's hold
cd Push_swap_sweater

```

## 🎮 Usage - Time to Set Sail!

Run the script like ye're raisin' the Jolly Roger:

```bash
# Basic usage - for when ye're still learnin' the ropes
python tester.py
```

## 📜 The Rules of Engagement

Just like the Pirate Code, these be more like guidelines:

1. **sa** - Swap the first two elements at the top of stack A (like switchin' yer rum bottles)
2. **sb** - Swap the first two elements at the top of stack B (switchin' yer grog mugs)
3. **pa** - Push the top element from stack B to stack A (boardin' the enemy ship!)
4. **pb** - Push the top element from stack A to stack B (makin' 'em walk the plank!)
5. **ra** - Rotate stack A upwards (spinnin' the ship's wheel!)
6. **rb** - Rotate stack B upwards (raisin' the anchor!)
7. **rr** - Rotate both stacks (battlin' a maelstrom!)

## 🏴 Why "Sweater"?

Because this challenge'll make ye sweat so much, ye'll need a sweater to keep from catchin' cold when the sweat dries! Even the saltiest of sea dogs find themselves soaked through after tanglin' with this algorithmic kraken!

## 🎯 Challenge Yerself!

Can ye sort these numbers in less than:
- **3 numbers**: 3 moves (Cabin Boy level)
- **5 numbers**: 12 moves (Deckhand level)
- **100 numbers**: 700 moves (First Mate level)
- **500 numbers**: 5500 moves (Captain level)👑

## 💬 Final Words from the Captain

> "Not all treasure be silver and gold, mate. Sometimes it be the algorithms we optimize along the way!" 
> - Captain Code Beard

Now quit yer lollygaggin' and start sortin'! May the winds be at yer back and may ye never have to sort a reverse-ordered stack of 500 numbers! ⚓

**🏴‍☠️ Happy Sweatin', Ye Salty Sea Dogs! 🏴‍☠️**

*P.S. - If ye find a bug, it be a feature! We call 'em "unexpected sea monsters"* 🐙
